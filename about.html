    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>
        Sweet Food Stories is a website created to celebrate the joy of cooking and the stories behind every recipe. 
        Every dish has a memory, a moment, or a person connected to it, and this project brings those stories to life 
        through simple, warm, and inviting design.
    </p>

    <p>
        The purpose of this website is to share recipes, personal food memories, and cultural traditions in a way that 
        feels friendly and meaningful. Whether it’s a dessert passed down through generations or a new recipe discovered 
        by accident, each story adds flavor to the experience.
    </p>

    <p>
        This project was created as part of a web design course, and it reflects my interest in combining storytelling 
        with food culture. The goal is to make visitors feel inspired, connected, and hungry for more.
